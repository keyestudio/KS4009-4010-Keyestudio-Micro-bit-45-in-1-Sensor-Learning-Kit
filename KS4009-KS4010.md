# 3.Introduction

**3.1 What is Micro:bit?**

Designed by BBC, Micro:bit main board aims to help children aged above 10 years old to have a better learning of programming.

It is equipped with loads of components,including a 5*5 LED dot matrix, 2 programmable buttons, a compass, a Micro USB interface and a Bluetooth module and others. Though it is just the size of a credit card, it boasts multiple functions. To name just a few, it can be applied in programming video games, making interactions between light and sound, controlling a robot, conducting scientific experiments, developing wearable devices and make some cool inventions like robots and musical instruments, basically everything imaginable.

This new version, that’s the version 2.0, of Micro:bit main board has a touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone. And there is a buzzer built in the other side of the board which makes playing all kinds of sound possible without any external equipment. The golden fingers and gears added provide a better fixing of crocodile clips. Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower the
power consumption of battery and it can be entered if users long press the Reset& Power button on the back of it. More importantly, the CPU capacity of this version is much better than that of the V1.5 and the V2 has more RMA.

In final analysis, the Micro:bit main board V2 can allow customers to explore more functions so as to make more innovative products.

**3.2 Comparison between V2.0 & V1.5**

**3.4 Notes for the application of Micro:bit main board V2.0**

1.  it is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.
2.  its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large current,such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore, you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a Micro:bit shield.
3.  It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: Bit expansion board is required.
4.   When using pins(P3、P4、P6、P7、P10)shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking them from the matrix or the LEDs may     display randomly and the data about sensors maybe wrong.
5.  The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the main board will be damaged. Forbid to use it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a microcomputer which has made programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And about programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/,>which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

# 4. Install Micro:bit driver

If you have downloaded micro:bit driver, then no need to download it again.

If it is you first time to use micro:bit main board, then you will have to download the driver.

First of all, connect the micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

And enter website:
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5mv8mvvufti0uj/AADTFPTV8NBN0IxQj_3TZ8ETa?dl=0> to download the driver file of micro:bit
![](media/0df7b2e579dea239caf6eaf20d2a6dfe.png).

# 5. Getting Started with Micro:bit

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as a reference if you are using a different system.

## 5.1 Write code and program

This chapter describes how to write program with the App Micro: Bit and load the program to the Micro: Bit main board V2.

You are recommended to browse the official website of Micro:bit for more details, and the link is attached below:

[https://microbit.org/guide/quick/](Https://microbit.org/guide/quick/)

**Step 1: connect the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer**

Firstly, link the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer via the USB cable.Macs、PCs、 Chromebooks and Linux （including Raspberry Pi）systems are all compatible with the Micro: Bit main board V2.

Note that if you are about to pair the board with your phone or tablet, please refer to this link:

<https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/>

![6(1)](media/f00f946e1f194811b1c84725e0eb5d16.png)
![5(1)](media/f44b10aa08f2d5862499e7efed84e040.png)

Secondly, if the red LED on the back of the board is on, that means the board is powered. Then Micro: Bit main board V2 will appear on your computer as a driver named 'MICROBIT(E:)'. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown below.

![](media/a2b53f93f4c24b81fc5cdb5986fd100d.png)

**Step 2: write programs**

View the link https://makecode.microbit.org/ in your browser;

Click ‘New Project’;

The dialog box‘Create a Project’ appears, fill it with ‘heartbeat’ and click ‘Create √’ to edit.

(If you are running Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. And the link to the APP is [https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab))

![](media/397bd09e4c2baf3c933857f3d0d1b83f.png)

![](media/5427d2c4fbb30ffdbce2fe9315244245.png)

Write a set of micro:bit code. You can drag some modules in the Blocks to the editing area and then run your program in Simulator of MakeCode editor as shown in the picture below which demonstrates how to edit ‘heartbeat’ program .

As for loading test code , please turn to Chapter 5.5. And introduction of Makecode is on the next chapter 5.2.

![](media/a6aa8681158ce5b64ffba50c1238f8c8.png)

**Step 3: download test code**

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write program, what you will have to do to download the program to your Micro: Bit main board V2 is merely clicking the ‘Download’ button, then all is done.

If you are writing programs through the website, following these steps:

Click the ‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact program format that the Micro: Bit main board can read. Once the hexadecimal file is downloaded, copy it to your board V2 just like the process that you copy the file to the USB driver. If you are running Windows system, you can also right-click and select ‘Send to → MICROBIT (E:) ‘to copy the hex file to the Micro: Bit main board V2.

![](media/a81d4430eb152346d13bf67b2233b9db.png)

You can also directly drag the "hex" file onto the MICROBIT (E:) disk.

![](media/fe0f2de72ba0b38f00403f1aaef7f514.png)

![](media/b4f3602c0e192646f77b150e2acaf947.png)

During the process of copying the downloaded hex file to the Micro: Bit main board V2, the yellow signal light on the back side of the board flashes. When the copy is completed, the yellow signal light will stop flashing and remain on.

**Step 4: run the program**

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2, you could still power it via the USB cable or change to via an external power. The 5 x 5 LED dot matrix on the board displays the heartbeat pattern.

![7](media/c27f510a9fea3692efb97c75a51e3556.png)

Power via micro USB cable

![8](media/133370be927147612643a72552e2e889.png)

Power via external power（3V）

**Step 5：Learn about other programming languages**

This chapter has described how to use the Micro: Bit main board V2.

But except for the Makecode graphical programming introduced you can also write Micro: Bit programs in other languages. Go to the link:<https://microbit.org/code/> to know about other programming languages , or view the link: <https://microbit.org/projects/>, to find something you want to have a go.

## 5.2 Makecode：

Browse <https://makecode.microbit.org/> and enter Makecode online editor or open the APP MakeCode for micro:bit of Windows 10.

![](media/306e32b77a5dae6927b5dd0f6cf6f4f4.png)

Click“New Project”, and input“heartbeat”，then enter Makecode editor, as shown below:

![](media/c5d52e632549cae8e23944f8febe5a03.png)

There are blocks“on start”and“forever”in the code editing area.

When the power is plugged or reset,“on start”means that the code in the block only executes once, while“forever”implies that the code runs cyclically.

## 5.3. Quick Download

As mentioned before, if your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write programs, the program written can be quickly downloaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2 by selecting ‘Download’.

While it is a little more trickier if you are using a browser to enter makecode. However, if you use Google Chrome, suitable for Linux，macOS and Windows 10, the process can be quicker too.

We use the webUSB function of Chrome to allow the internet page to access the hardware device connected USB.

Note: if your computer system is Windows7 or 8 instead of Windows 10, the pairing cannot be done via Google Chrome. Therefore, digital signal or analog signal of sensors and modules cannot be shown on the serial port simulator. However, you need to read the corresponding digital signal or analog signal. So what can we do? You can use the CoolTerm software to read the serial port data of the micro:bit. Next chapter is about how to install CoolTerm.

## 5.6 CoolTerm Installation

CoolTerm program is used to read the data on serial port.

Download CoolTerm program:

<https://freeware.the-meiers.org/>

## Project 6: Geomagnetic Sensor

![](media/24c31bb0174e2ac672203e5c36c6875e.png)

**( 1 )Project Description:**

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the navigation attitude reference system (AHRS). Micro: Bit main board V2 uses LSM303AGR geomagnetic sensor, and the dynamic range of magnetic field is ±50 gauss. In the board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and compass.

In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the original data of the magnetometer will be checked.The main component of a common compass is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and point toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South Pole) to determine direction.

**( 2 )Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board V2 \*1

-   Micro USB cable\*1

**( 3 )Test Code 1：**

Link computer with micro:bit board by micro USB cable, and program in MakeCode editor.

The other is to use the software's own function, input the square waves of different frequencies and different lengths on the P0 end. Finally make the buzzer module play the song "Ode to Joy". (The input PIO port can only be P0, can not be other interfaces).

**Component Required:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

-   keyestudio Passive Buzzer Module\*1

-   Dupont jumper wire\*3

Buzzers can be categorized as active and passive ones. The difference between the two is that an active buzzer has a built-in oscillating source, so it will generate a sound when electrified. The buzzer used on this module is a passive buzzer. A passive buzzer does not have such a source, so DC signal cannot drive it beep. Instead, you need to use square waves whose frequency is between 2K and 5K to drive it. Different frequencies produce different sounds. You can use micro:bit to code the melody of a song, quite fun and simple.

The tracking sensor is actually an infrared sensor, which can detect a black line. The component used in the sensor is TCRT5000 infrared tube.

Its working principle is to use the different reflectivity of infrared light to the color, then convert the strength of the reflected signal into a current signal.

When sensor detects a black line, the infrared rays are not emitted or the intensity of emitted ray back are not sufficiently strong, so that the sensor’s signal terminal outputs a High level. Otherwise, output a Low level.

In this way, we can judge the detected color by High or Low level of the sensor’s signal terminal.

Note: on the module, you can rotate the potentiometer to make the LED between on and off state. The sensitivity is the best.

Or else show the number 0.

Note: rotate the potentiometer on the sensor, the sensitivity is highest when make the LED on and off state. The detection height is 0—3 cm.

## Project 27: Obstacle Avoidance

**Overview**

When doing DIY experiments, you perhaps see such a smart car that can automatically avoid an obstacle ahead. How can achieve this? Yeah, make use of infrared obstacle avoidance sensors. In this project, we will use a obstacle sensor combined with micro:bit to detect an object ahead and automatically avoid it. You can get the result shown on the LED display of micro:bit.

**Component Introduction**

**Obstacle Avoidance Sensor:**

The infrared obstacle detector sensor is actually a distance-adjustable obstacle avoidance sensor.

It has a pair of infrared transmitting and receiving tubes. The transmitter emits an infrared ray of a certain frequency. When the detection direction encounters an obstacle (reflecting surface), the infrared rays are reflected back, and receiving tube will receive it. At this time, the signal terminal will output Low level.

If no obstacle detected, the infrared ray emitted is weakened by the distance it travels and eventually disappears, so receiving tube cannot receive it and signal end of sensor will output High level.

In this case, it can judge whether there is an obstacle ahead or not.

You can rotate the potentiometer knob on the sensor to adjust the detection distance. The effective distance is 2-40cm and working voltage is 3.3V-5V.

**Component Required:**

**Note:** for obstacle sensor, you can rotate the two potentiometers on the sensor to adjust its sensitivity. Rotate the potentiometer near the infrared transmitter tube clockwise to the end, and then adjust the potentiometer near the infrared receiver. Sled light is turned off and keeps the critical point to be lit. The sensing distance is the longest.

The effective distance of the sensor is within 2-40 cm.

## Project 28: Someone Comes

When some special forces go to the target, they will be covered with moist mud, so that they will not be discovered by the other party. Why ?

Originally, the human body will emit a certain wavelength of infrared rays of about 10um. The relevant sensors are installed near the targets that are being attacked to sense the infrared rays emitted by the human body and then alarm. After the mud is applied, the sensors can not sense the infrared rays emitted by the human body.

**Reed Switch Module:**

The keyestudio reed switch module is mainly composed of a reed switch. The reed switch is a mechanical magnetic switch, a passive device. Its working principle is that the magnetic field magnetizes its reed, so that it can be turned on and off to achieve the switch effect. However, since it is a contact type switch, its working life is limited, and it is easy to be damaged during transportation and installation.

The main component used in keyestudio Hall Magnetic Sensor is the A3144E, which is an electronic magnetic device, active device. And the output form is a switch type. It uses magnetic fields and Hall effects for contactless control purposes. Since the Hall element itself is a chip, its working life is theoretically unlimited.

Reed switch has been widely applied in household appliances, cars, communication, industry, health care and security areas.

Furthermore, it can also be applied to other sensors and electric devices such as liquidometer, door magnet, reed relay and more.

**Overview**

Ultrasonic sensor is great for all kind of projects that need distance measurements, avoiding obstacles as examples.

In this project, you will learn how to use a ultrasonic module and micro:bit to detect the distance between the module and an obstacle ahead.

**Component Introduction**

**Ultrasonic Module:**

This Ultrasonic detector module HC-SR04 can provide 2cm-450cm non-contact measurement distance, and its ranging accuracy is up to 3mm. It includes an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver and control circuit.

Ultrasonic module will emit the ultrasonic waves after trigger signal. When the ultrasonic waves encounter an object and are reflected back, the module outputs an echo signal, so it can determine the distance of object from the time difference between trigger signal and echo signal.

The basic principle of work as follows:

![](media/a7b0fc57b2e387962071da618153ad68.jpeg)

1) First pull down the TRIG, and then trigger it with at least 10us high level signal;

2) After triggering, the module will automatically transmit eight 40KHZ square waves, and automatically detect whether there is a pulse signal back.

3) If there is a signal back, through the ECHO to output a high level, the duration time of high level is actually the time from sending ultrasonic to returning back.

Test distance = high level duration \* velocity of sound (340m/s) \* 0.5

## Project 53: IR Remote Control Decoding

![IMG_256](media/15738d377302235d38def0d2637df338.jpeg)

**Overview**

There is no doubt that infrared remote control is commonly seen in our daily life. It's hard to imagine our world without it.

An infrared remote control can be used to control a wide range of home appliances such as television, audio, video recorders and satellite signal receivers.

Well, in the following let’s get a better understanding of the infrared remote control.

Infrared remote control is composed of infrared transmitting and infrared receiving systems. That is, consist of an infrared remote control, an infrared receiver module and a microcontroller that can decode. You can refer to the figure below.

![800px-KS0313_4-1-1](media/9980b41f57feddc2e8a9c0346afaaea9.png)

The 38K infrared carrier signal transmitted by an infrared remote controller is encoded by an encoding chip inside the remote controller. It is composed of a pilot code, user code, data code, and data inversion code.

The time interval between pulses is used to distinguish whether it is a signal 0 or 1. (when the ratio of high level to low level is about 1:1, considered as signal 0.) And the encoding is just well composed of signal 0 and 1.

The user code of the same button on remote controller is unchanged. Using difference data distinguish the key pressed on the remote control.

When press down a button on the remote control, it will send out an infrared carrier signal. And when infrared receiver receives that signal, its program will decode the carrier signal, and through different data codes, thus can judge which key is pressed.

The microcontroller is decoded by an received signal 0 or 1 to determine which key is pressed by the remote control.
